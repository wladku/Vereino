# Software delivery process

## Purpose

This file documents how work flows from ticket to merged PR in this repository. The agent skills configured in `.ai/agentic.config.json` enforce the process; humans read it here. PRs target `main` (resolved at runtime from the repository's default branch, `baseBranch: "auto"`); issues and PRs live in GitHub, with every tracker operation the skills run defined in `.ai/trackers/github.md` (edit that file to extend or override tracker behavior).

Work enters through two paths: a free-form task brief handed to an agent, or a filed ticket. Both converge on the same review loop, the same validation gate, and the same merge gates. Project rules that apply on every path — spec gate, `.ai/runs/` run logs, `.ai/lessons/` records — live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Roles

- **Author** — the human or agent who writes the change. Owns the ticket from claim to a merge-ready PR.
- **Reviewer** — reads the diff and approves or requests changes. May be a human or the `om-auto-review-pr` skill; the `om-code-review` checklist applies either way, together with `CODE_REVIEW.md` and `.ai/review-checklist.md`.
- **Maintainer** — owns branch protection, the label taxonomy, the config, and this document; arbitrates when gates conflict.

## Ticket lifecycle

| Stage | What happens | Driven by | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intake | A ticket or task brief is filed in GitHub with enough detail to act on. New capability, schema, API contract or multi-phase work goes through a spec in `.ai/specs/` first (see `AGENTS.md`, Axis 3). | Anyone | Ticket exists |
| Triage | Confirm the issue is real, still unfixed on `main`, and not already claimed or covered by an open PR. Read-only; stops the chain cleanly when there is nothing to do. | `om-verify-in-repo` or a human | Confirmed actionable, or closed as no-action |
| Claim | The author claims the ticket so concurrent agents back off. See the claim protocol below. | `om-fix` / `om-auto-create-pr`, or a human | Claim visible on the ticket |
| Implement | Locate the minimal change surface (`om-root-cause`, read-only), then implement the change with regression tests and run the validation gate. Task briefs without a ticket go through `om-auto-create-pr`, which plans, implements phase by phase in an isolated worktree, and runs the same gate. | `om-root-cause` + `om-fix`, `om-auto-create-pr`, or a human author | Change complete, validation gate green |
| PR | Commit, push, and open a PR against `main` with normalized labels. On a hand-worked branch, `om-check-and-commit` runs the gate, fixes obvious drift, and pushes when green. | `om-open-pr`, `om-auto-create-pr`, or `om-check-and-commit` | Open, labeled PR |
| Review loop | The reviewer reads the diff against the `om-code-review` checklist and approves or requests changes. Requested changes are addressed (`om-auto-continue-pr` resumes agent PRs from the tracking plan) and the PR is re-reviewed until approved. | `om-auto-review-pr` (single PR), `om-review-prs` (sweep), or a human | Approving review submitted |
| Merge | `om-merge-buddy` reports, read-only, which PRs can merge now and which are close but blocked. `om-approve-merge-pr` re-checks every gate, approves, and squash-merges. | `om-merge-buddy` + `om-approve-merge-pr`, or a human | PR squash-merged into `main` |
| Post-merge housekeeping | Close issues the merged PR fixes; comment on issues whose PRs were closed without merging; turn leftover asks or review comments into tracked follow-up issues. | `om-close-fixed-issues`, `om-followup-issue-from-pr` | Tracker reconciled, follow-ups filed |

## Label state machine

Pipeline labels are mutually exclusive: a PR carries at most one, and it names where the PR sits in the flow.

- A ready, non-draft PR carries `review`.
- The reviewer moves it: request changes → `changes-requested`; after fixes it returns to `review`; approval → `merge-queue`.
- `qa` and `qa-failed` are set only by a human doing manual QA. Automated skills may request QA with `needs-qa`; they never set `qa`.
- `blocked` and `do-not-merge` are set and cleared by humans and stop the flow wherever it is.

| Group | Labels | Exclusivity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pipeline | `review`, `changes-requested`, `qa`, `qa-failed`, `merge-queue`, `blocked`, `do-not-merge` | one at a time | Workflow state |
| Category | `bug`, `feature`, `refactor`, `security`, `dependencies`, `documentation` | additive | Kind of change |
| Meta | `needs-qa`, `skip-qa`, `qa-approved`, `qa-self-verified`, `in-progress`, `ci-monitoring`, `screenshots` | additive | Process signals |
| Priority | `priority-low`, `priority-medium`, `priority-high`, `priority-extreme` | one at a time; unset = medium | Urgency of the work |
| Risk | `risk-low`, `risk-medium`, `risk-high` | one at a time; unset = medium | Blast radius of the change |

`ci-monitoring` marks a PR whose work is finished and reported while an agent watches CI; it is not a claim (see `.ai/trackers/github.md`). `screenshots` marks a PR that carries UI screenshots from the working app as evidence.

Priority is how urgent the work is; risk is how dangerous the change is to ship. A one-line fix for an outage can be `priority-extreme` and `risk-low`; a large auth refactor that can wait can be `priority-low` and `risk-high`. A PR inherits both from its source issue unless the scope clearly changed. When an automated skill adds or changes a pipeline or meta label, it leaves a short comment explaining why.

When no priority label is set, infer one:

- `priority-extreme` — production outage, data loss, or an active security incident.
- `priority-high` — security hardening or a release-blocking regression.
- `priority-medium` — ordinary bug fixes and net-new features (also the default reading of unset).
- `priority-low` — cosmetic, docs-only, dependency bumps, follow-up cleanup.

When no risk label is set, infer one:

- `risk-high` — auth, sessions, tenant/organization scoping, encryption, money, schema migrations, surfaces listed in `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, or broad cross-cutting edits.
- `risk-medium` — an ordinary single-area change that ships with tests (also the default reading of unset).
- `risk-low` — docs-only, test-only, typo, or isolated cosmetic changes.

When signals conflict, pick the higher label and say why in the label comment. A `risk-high` PR strengthens the case for `needs-qa` and deeper review even when it would otherwise look routine.

One label lives outside this taxonomy: `do-not-close`, applied by humans to issues that housekeeping skills must never auto-close. Skills only ever read it.

## QA

The QA gate is off (`qaGate: false`): `needs-qa` is advisory and does not block a merge on its own. User-facing changes are still proven by the author with browser evidence as `AGENTS.md` requires (both locales, 375 px, console without errors). `qa-failed`, `do-not-merge` and `blocked` remain hard blocks, and an active `qa` label means a tester is on the PR right now — never merge under an active tester. To make `needs-qa` a hard block until `qa-approved`, set `qaGate: true` and re-run `om-setup-agent-pipeline`.

## The claim protocol

Before mutating an issue or PR, an agent claims it with all three signals: it assigns itself, adds the `in-progress` label, and posts a `🤖`-prefixed claim comment saying what it is doing. Any agent that finds an existing claim backs off instead of colliding. A PR carrying `in-progress` is also skipped by the merge tooling.

The claim is released when the work finishes — on success and on failure alike. A stale `in-progress` with no recent activity may be cleared by the maintainer.

## The automation contract

The `om-auto-*` skills run this process unattended and are chainable: each accepts the artifact the previous one produced (an issue id, a spec path, or a PR number from the `PR: #<number> (link: <url>)` reference line every PR-producing skill emits), and each detects work already started — an open PR referencing the issue or plan — and continues on it rather than opening a duplicate. A completed autonomous run leaves a **ready** (non-draft), fully labeled PR — one pipeline label, category, QA meta, one priority, one risk — with a run-summary comment, a committed run log in `.ai/runs/`, and, for user-facing changes, screenshots from the working app attached as PR evidence. Draft PRs are reserved for explicitly incomplete states: spec-only design PRs, interrupted hand-offs, or autonomous defaults flagged for human confirmation. Automation never applies `qa-approved`.

## Validation gate

Every PR passes the full validation gate before review sign-off, in this order:

- `yarn verify`

Any non-zero exit fails the gate and blocks the PR. `yarn verify` is the only gate command and is identical locally and in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); `yarn verify --list` shows its steps and `yarn verify --from <step>` resumes after a fix. CI additionally runs `yarn test:integration:vereino` and the agent-browser login smoke. The implementing skills run the gate before opening a PR, and `om-check-and-commit` runs it before pushing a hand-worked branch. The command list lives in `.ai/agentic.config.json`; when it changes, update it there and in this section together.

## Amending this process

This document and `.ai/agentic.config.json` describe the same process: change them together, and re-run the `om-setup-agent-pipeline` skill when the toolchain or label taxonomy changes. Per-skill deviations — extra review rules, a different PR body template, an added gate step — belong in a repo-local skill of the same name at `.ai/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, which takes precedence over the installed skill (and can `@`-import or reference it to extend rather than replace it); local rules win, but a repo-local skill cannot grant what the installed skill's safety rules forbid.
